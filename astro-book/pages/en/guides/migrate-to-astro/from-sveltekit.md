# Migrating from SvelteKit

[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) is a framework for building web applications on top of Svelte.

## Key Similarities between SvelteKit and Astro

[Section titled “Key Similarities between SvelteKit and Astro”](#key-similarities-between-sveltekit-and-astro)

SvelteKit and Astro share some similarities that will help you migrate your project:

- 
Both SvelteKit and Astro are modern JavaScript static-site generators and server-side rendering frameworks. 
- 
Both SvelteKit and Astro use a `src/`folder for your project files[special folder for file-based routing](/en/basics/astro-pages/). Creating and managing pages for your site should feel familiar.
- 
Astro has [an official integration for using Svelte components](/en/guides/integrations-guide/svelte/)and supports[installing NPM packages](/en/guides/imports/#npm-packages), including several for Svelte. You will be able to write Svelte UI components, and may be able to keep some or all of your existing components and dependencies.
- 
Astro and SvelteKit both allow you to use a [headless CMS, APIs or Markdown files for data](/en/guides/data-fetching/). You can continue to use your preferred content authoring system, and will be able to keep your existing content.

## Key Differences between SvelteKit and Astro

[Section titled “Key Differences between SvelteKit and Astro”](#key-differences-between-sveltekit-and-astro)

When you rebuild your SvelteKit site in Astro, you will notice some important differences:

- 
Astro sites are multi-page apps, whereas SvelteKit defaults to SPAs (single-page applications) with server-side rendering, but can also create MPAs, traditional SPAs, or you can mix and match these techniques within an app. 
- 
[Components](/en/basics/astro-components/): SvelteKit uses[Svelte](https://svelte.dev). Astro pages are built using`.astro`components[React, Preact, Vue.js, Svelte, SolidJS, AlpineJS](/en/guides/framework-components/)and raw HTML templating.
- 
[content-driven](/en/concepts/why-astro/#content-driven): Astro was designed to showcase your content and to allow you to opt-in to interactivity only as needed. An existing SvelteKit app might be built for high client-side interactivity. Astro has built-in capabilities for working with your content, such as page generation, but may require advanced Astro techniques to include items that are more challenging to replicate using`.astro`components, such as dashboards.
- 
[Markdown-ready](/en/guides/markdown-content/): Astro includes built-in Markdown support, and includes a[special frontmatter YAML](/en/basics/layouts/#markdown-layouts)used per-file for page templating. If you are converting a SvelteKit Markdown-based blog, you will not have to install a separate Markdown integration and you will not set a layout via a configuration file. You can bring your existing Markdown files, but you may need to reorganize as Astro’s file-based routing does not require a folder for each page route.`layout`property

## Switch from SvelteKit to Astro

[Section titled “Switch from SvelteKit to Astro”](#switch-from-sveltekit-to-astro)

To convert a SvelteKit blog to Astro, start with our blog theme starter template, or explore more community blog themes in our [theme showcase](https://astro.build/themes/).

You can pass a `--template` argument to the `create astro` command to start a new Astro project with one of our official starters. Or, you can [start a new project from any existing Astro repository on GitHub](/en/install-and-setup/#install-from-the-cli-wizard).

Bring your existing Markdown (or MDX, with our optional integration) files as content to [create Markdown or MDX pages](/en/guides/markdown-content/).

While file-based routing and layout components are similar in Astro, you may wish to read about [Astro’s project structure](/en/basics/project-structure/) to learn where files should be located.

To convert other types of sites, such as a portfolio or documentation site, see more official starter templates on [astro.new](https://astro.new). You’ll find a link to each project’s GitHub repository, as well as one-click links to open a working project in StackBlitz and CodeSandbox online development environments.
