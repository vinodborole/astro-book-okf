# Building Astro sites with AI tools

AI-powered editors and agentic coding tools generally have good knowledge of Astro’s core APIs and concepts. However, some may use older APIs and may not be aware of newer features or recent changes to the framework.

This guide covers how to enhance AI tools with up-to-date Astro knowledge and provides best practices for building Astro sites with AI assistance.

## Astro Docs MCP Server

[Section titled “Astro Docs MCP Server”](#astro-docs-mcp-server)

You can ensure your AI tools have current Astro knowledge through the Astro Docs MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. This provides real-time access to the latest documentation, helping AI tools avoid outdated recommendations and ensuring they understand current best practices.

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) is a standardized way for AI tools to access external tools and data sources.

Unlike AI models trained on static data, the MCP server provides access to the latest Astro documentation. The server is free, open-source, and runs remotely with nothing to install locally.

The Astro Docs MCP server uses the [kapa.ai](https://www.kapa.ai/) API to maintain an up-to-date index of the Astro documentation.

### Server Details

[Section titled “Server Details”](#server-details)

- **Name** : Astro Docs
- **URL** :`https://mcp.docs.astro.build/mcp`
- **Transport** : Streamable HTTP

### Installation

[Section titled “Installation”](#installation)

The setup process varies depending on your AI development tool. You may see some tools refer to MCP servers as connectors, adapters, extensions, or plugins.

#### Manual setup

[Section titled “Manual setup”](#manual-setup)

Many tools support a common JSON configuration format for MCP servers. If there are not specific instructions for your chosen tool, you may be able to add the Astro Docs MCP server by including the following configuration in your tool’s MCP settings:

You can configure it to use the Astro Docs MCP server for documentation access by adding the following to your repository’s Copilot coding agent settings available at `https://github.com/<your-org>/<your-repo>/settings/copilot/coding_agent`:

Learn more about [extending GitHub Copilot coding agent with MCP servers](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/extend-coding-agent-with-mcp).

Once configured, you can ask your AI tool questions about Astro, and it will retrieve information directly from the latest docs. Coding agents will be able to consult the latest documentation when performing coding tasks, and chatbots will be able to accurately answer questions about Astro features, APIs, and best practices.

The Astro Docs MCP server provides access to current documentation, but your AI tools are still responsible for interpretation and code generation. AI makes mistakes, so always review generated code carefully and test thoroughly.

### Troubleshooting

[Section titled “Troubleshooting”](#troubleshooting)

If you encounter issues:

- Verify that your tool supports streamable HTTP transport.
- Check that the server URL is correct: `https://mcp.docs.astro.build/mcp` .
- Ensure your tool has proper internet access.
- Consult your specific tool’s MCP integration documentation.

If you are still having problems, open an issue in the [Astro Docs MCP Server repository](https://github.com/withastro/docs-mcp/issues).

## Discord AI Support

[Section titled “Discord AI Support”](#discord-ai-support)

The same technology that powers Astro’s MCP server is also available as a chatbot in the [Astro Discord](https://astro.build/chat) for self-serve support. Visit the `#support-ai` channel to ask questions about Astro or your project code in natural language. Your conversation is automatically threaded, and you can ask an unlimited number of follow-up questions.

**Conversations with the chatbot are public, and are subject to the same server rules for language and behavior as the rest of our channels**, but they are not actively visited by our volunteer support members. For assistance from the community, please create a thread in our regular `#support` channel.

## Background mode

[Section titled “Background mode”](#background-mode)

	**Added in:**
	`astro@7.0.0`
	
	

When an AI coding agent is detected, `astro dev` automatically starts the dev server as a detached background process. This prevents the dev server from blocking the agent’s terminal and allows it to continue working while the server runs.

A lock file (`.astro/dev.json`) is written when the dev server starts, recording the server’s URL, port, and PID. This prevents duplicate servers from being started for the same project.

If you are not using an AI coding agent, `astro dev` starts in the foreground process and logs to the terminal.

To opt out of automatic background mode, set the `ASTRO_DEV_BACKGROUND` environment variable before running `astro dev`:

[CLI reference](/en/reference/cli-reference/#astro-dev)for the full list of

`astro dev` flags and subcommands.
### Health endpoint

[Section titled “Health endpoint”](#health-endpoint)

The dev server exposes a `/_astro/status` endpoint that returns `{"ok": true}` as JSON. This allows agents and other tools to check programmatically whether the dev server is ready to accept requests. This endpoint is only available in the dev server and does not exist in production builds.

## Tips for AI-Powered Astro Development

[Section titled “Tips for AI-Powered Astro Development”](#tips-for-ai-powered-astro-development)

- **Start with templates** : Rather than building from scratch, ask AI tools to start with an existing[Astro template](https://astro.build/themes/) or use`npm create astro@latest` with a template option.
- **Use `astro add` for integrations** : Ask AI tools to use`astro add` for official integrations (e.g.`astro add tailwind` ,`astro add react` ). For other packages, install using the command for your preferred package manager rather than editing`package.json` directly.
- **Verify current APIs** : AI tools may use outdated patterns. Ask them to check the latest documentation, especially for newer features like sessions and actions. This is also important for features that have seen significant changes since their initial launch, such as content collections, or previously experimental features that may no longer be experimental.
- **Use project rules** : If your AI tool supports it, set up project rules to enforce best practices and coding standards, such as the ones listed above.
